<p style=""direction: ltr; "">I wanted to buy some electric items for my house in which my children and I live. I had no cash, so I went to someone who has cash, and he said: I will buy them for you. So he bought them for 7540 riyals, and sold them to me for 9400 riyals, to be paid in monthly instalments, one thousand riyals every month. What is the Islamic ruling on that?</p>
